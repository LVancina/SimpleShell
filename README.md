# SimpleShell
This is a simple shell that I wrote as part of an assignment for CS503, Systems Basics at Drexel University Online.
The goal was to create as shell that is able to perform basic functions such as backgrounding processes and input redirection.
This project is a work in progress and still isn't where I want it to be yet.
This program is meant to be run in a Unix environment. I use the Cygwin compiler to run it on my Windows OS.
